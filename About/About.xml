<description>The purpose of this mod is to add a significant amount of new animals and plants to the game and increase fauna and flora biome diversity.

12/28/16 A16 update note: Tammabanana updated from the current state of the authors' GitHub, which included a few changes Kaptain made since their last official release:

* New textures for dreamvine, lemongrass, coffee, cobra, junglehen;
* Monkeys are now herd animals, and also got a texture change;
* Coffee was replaced with jitter weed/berries;
* Pandas spawn less frequently.
* but NOT this: Elephants were intended to be a pack animal, but A16 ditched the "carrier" tag and this broke, so I've commented it out for now. </description>

Tammabanana will fix obvious bugs, particularly ones that are her own dang fault from the A16 update, but will NOT be adding new content or making content changes.
